## About Me

Writes code that works… eventually.  
Living proof that “it compiled” is not the same as “it works.”  
I break things to learn how they work. Sometimes on purpose.

Not a rockstar, not a ninja. Just someone who reads error messages and Googles better than yesterday.  
Currently building stuff with Python, containers, automation, and whatever else seems fun this week.  
Pushing to GitHub like someone’s watching.
